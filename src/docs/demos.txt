This is an overview of the demo programs provided. 
These can be found in the bin directory after executing "make".

If compiled with shared=N and link_app_into_server=Y
the demos can be called from src directory with e.g.
"bin/demo6 landmine.ppm"

Otherwise use a shell script and load nano-X
before the application. E.g.:
