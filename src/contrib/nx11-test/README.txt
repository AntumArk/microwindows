How to execute the programs depends on the settings in the config file.

If LINK_APP_INTO_SERVER was set to "N" when you compiled the programs then 
you have to run the nano-X server first using ./run.sh to execute the programs.

Then, you can click on the program name in your file manager or enter e.g.
./xhello on the command line.
