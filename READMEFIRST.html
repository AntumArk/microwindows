<h3>Basic Instructions for Building, Installing, and Executing Microwindows under X11</h3>
<h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
After downloading the Microwindows package, unpack it into a suitable directory. This is usually a new one under <br>
your personal or home directory on your Linux system.<br>
<br>
<br> For a Quickbuild, you can follow these instructions, for further details and the Latest FAQ, please read <br>
the /doc/faq2.<br>
<br>
Open up a Terminal or Console and go into the "microwindows/src" directory. <br>
<br>
There is no need to run ./configure with Microwindows, it's makefile is smart enough and builds everything locally. <br>
<br>
Enter: "make". <br>
<br>
Make will now build the Microwindows libraries and the demo applications for you, and in the "src/lib" directory <br>
you will now find the newly generated libraries and in the "src/bin" directory the newly compiled demo programs.<br>
<br>
Then enter "make install".<br>
<br> 
This installs the newly created files to your systems standard locations.<br>
The Makefile does assume that you are using a Linux system with X11 installed. <br>
For testing purposes, Microwindows should run on your X11 version and will generate shared not static libraries.<br>
<h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
To execute the demo programs run the script "rundemos.sh" in the "src" directory. This will list the <br>
available demos and allow you to select a program to run. Before selecting a new demo program, close all <br> 
windows opened by the previous demo. There is a "demos.txt" which contains short descriptions of these demos.<br>
<br>
These demos are based on the Nano-X and MWin apis. Demos for the X11 compatibility layer NX11 <br>
are located in the "nxlib/test" folder. You can run them in there e.g. with "./textbox". The scripts provided <br>
in the "nxlib/test" folder can be used if Nano-X is used as a static library. <br>
<br>
The Nano-X library and the NXlib compatibility layer library are also available linked together <br>
to the PX11 library. The demo programs linked with that are available in the "nxlib/ptest" folder.<br>
<h3>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h3>
Documentation is available in the "doc" folder. The latest information is in the "doc/faq2" file and in the <br>
"NX11 programming manual.html", which is the X11 compatibility library for Nano-X.<br>
Further documentation is currently dated. There is a tutorial for Nano-X and documentation regarding Nano-X in the <br>
nano-X folder. <br> 
<br>
A reference for the Nano-X API is in the "doc" folder. The Microsoft Windows compatible MWin API is described in<br>
the "doc/mwinapi.html" file. The MWin API implements a subset of the Microsoft Windows API.<br>
